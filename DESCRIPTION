Title: Testing Two-Sample Mean in High Dimension
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Huaiyu Zhang, Haiyan Wang

Description: Implements the high-dimensional two-sample test 
    proposed by Zhang (2019) <http://hdl.handle.net/2097/40235>. 
    It also implements the test proposed by Srivastava, Katayama, 
    and Kano (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2012.08.014>. These tests 
    are particularly suitable to high dimensional data from two populations 
    for which the classical multivariate Hotelling's T-square test fails due 
    to sample sizes smaller than dimensionality. In this case, the ZWL and ZWLm 
    tests proposed by Zhang (2019) <http://hdl.handle.net/2097/40235>, 
    referred to as zwl_test() in this package, provide a reliable and powerful test.
