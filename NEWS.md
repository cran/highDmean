# highDmean 0.1.0

This version the first release of the highDmean package. 

The functions `zwl_test()` and `SKK_test()` accept n by p and m by p data matrices with sample data from the first and second populations and return test statistics and p-values for the null hypothesis of equal means. 

The `buildData()` function simulates high-dimensional data in the two-population setting with specified sample sizes, numbers of components, covariance structure, etc., and the functions `zwl_sim()` and `SKK_sim()` return test statistic values and p-values for lists of simulated data sets generated by `buildData()`.
